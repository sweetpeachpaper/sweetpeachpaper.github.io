There’s nothing better than opening your mailbox to find a handwritten note inside. Are you planning on sending out Valentine’s this year?

On January 22, 2012, the USPS Postage rates went up, which means new stamp designs! (All stamp nerds raise your hands now).
Brides, for your save the dates, thank you cards, and reply cards, a 45 cent stamp is the ticket. If your wedding invitation suite is over 2-ounces (invitation, reply card with envelope, and enclosures), make sure you use a 65 cent stamp. And for all postcards (favorite!), use a 32 cent stamp.
For more stamp designs and a detailed rate change guide, visit [Beyond the Perf](http://beyondtheperf.com/content/2012-rate-change-guide). Happy snail-mailing!
