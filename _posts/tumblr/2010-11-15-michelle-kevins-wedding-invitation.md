For their fall wedding invitations, Michelle wanted something timeless and classic. Graceful cursive and autumn hydrangeas - their wedding flower of choice - were printed in a yummy eggplant purple, to compliment purple and green wedding colors.

Some brides and grooms are choosing these days to forgo traditional response cards and opt for website rsvps instead (easy to track, and an economical and green option to boot!). Michelle and Kevin’s website information was printed on a small tag and fixed to the invitation with a matching satin ribbon. A lovely way to relay pertinent information!
