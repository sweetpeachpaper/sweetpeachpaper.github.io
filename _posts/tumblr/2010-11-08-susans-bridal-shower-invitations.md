Here’s an up close and personal look at Susan’s bridal shower invitations. (Her shower was featured last week in a [post](/spp-on-jess-barfield-photographys-blog) with Jess Barfield Photography, but I couldn’t go without showing you all the great details of this lil’ gem.).

Most invitations SPP creates are standard A7 size. Don’t get me wrong, they’re great, but something fun and different was in order for Susan’s soiree. And a little two-page A6-er was the perfect solution. The first page of the invitation announced the affair and the date, while the second page contained all it’s juicy details.

This invitation was custom-made in every little detail. In keeping with the eclectic feel we wanted to have for the shower itself, this invitation featured oodles of great fonts and amusing wording. The two pages were held together by small brown brads, which also affixed a tiny tag with registry and rsvp information.

Of course, coordinating wrap-around address labels were used to bring the charm to the outside of the kraft envelope.

There’s nothing better than bringing details from the invitation to the party itself, tying visual details together! Name cards were used in kraft boxes with colorful mini macaroons.
