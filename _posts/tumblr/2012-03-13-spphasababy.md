I’ve been busy having a baby! That’s right. My husband, Paul, and I welcomed our sweet little girl into the world on February 15th.

Our little Ann Elise. 8lbs. 14oz. 21 inches. Hello world!
So, while I’m hanging out with this precious munchkin, I’ll be taking a break from the lovely world of Sweet Peach Paper. In May, Sweet Peach Paper will be back in action with a new website, a new line of party invitations, and taking custom wedding orders. Can’t wait to see y’all in May!

Until then, here’s another pic of my punkin.
