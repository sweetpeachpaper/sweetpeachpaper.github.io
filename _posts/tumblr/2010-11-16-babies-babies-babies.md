A dear friend and coworker asked me to design and print invitations for a baby shower she was throwing for her sis-in-law and soon to be baby girl. After discussing styles and color palettes, the design process began.

Commonplace ‘pink and green’ combos need not apply; we went with a poppy pink and citrusy green to keep things fresh. A sweet carriage, crisp diamond patterned background, and swirly girly fonts were the perfect combo for this shower. The kraft envelope was accompanied by an address label wrap to finish it off.

All it took was just a lil’ post on Twitter and Baby Edie was Miss Popularity. My sorority sister from college (aka : my kindred spirit) called me up and asked for her very own version for a baby shower she she would soon be throwing. To no surprise at all, Ashley’s good and classic tastes called for a pink and purple take for little Baby Caroline, and a blush pink and lavender were just the ticket.
