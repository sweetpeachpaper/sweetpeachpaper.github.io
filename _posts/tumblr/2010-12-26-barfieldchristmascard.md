What a Christmas gift … Sweet Peach Paper is on the [Jess Barfield Photography Blog](http://www.jessbarfield.com/blog), again!

It only took a couple email exchanges and a fun hour at Susan Ross’ bridal shower [soiree](/spp-on-jess-barfield-photographys-blog), and Jess and I were instant friends. When Jess asked me to design the Barfield’s Christmas Card this year, I was thrilled!

Jess’s creativity and her affinity for paper make me downright happy. Our meeting to discuss their Christmas Card design was full of lots of laughter, exchanging ideas, and of course a quick trip to the glove box of Jess’s car to gawk at her beautiful letterpress wedding invitations.

The front of Barfield Christmas Card featured a photo of the new addition to Jess and Blake’s family, their golden retriever puppy, Charley. On the back of the card, a strip of photos from their May wedding popped against a striped background. A tag wishing their friends “a very merry Christmas” tied around the card with twine, to add a little something extra. Of course this tucked into a kraft - always - envelope with coordinating address labels. Lots and lots of yummy bunting all over these babies. Mmmmm. I love it.
