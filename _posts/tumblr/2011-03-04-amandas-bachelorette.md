I was going through some old pictures the other day, trying to clean out the garbage that has collected in my iPhoto, and I stumbled across a bachelorette invitation I made for my nearest and dearest, Amanda Banks - I mean, Amanda Vessels - when she was getting married.

Apparently, the invitation craze was stirring two years ago. If I remember correctly, I printed these off at work (sorry HPPC) and had my first love/hate relationship with envelope liners.

For a girl who didn’t know what she was doing, I’d say these turned out pretty okay :).

I can hardly believe that its two years later, Amanda and I were both one another’s Maids of Honor and now, Mandy has a baby. Time goes by SO FAST and the Lord is SO GOOD.
Xoxo.
