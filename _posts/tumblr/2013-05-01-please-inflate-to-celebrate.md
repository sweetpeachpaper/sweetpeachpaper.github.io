It’s the first of May and the happy news is out! These soon-to-be parents wanted an upbeat and surprising way to announce their baby on the way...

Attached to the card was a bright red balloon with a customized message with the baby’s arrival date. Can you imagine receiving such a letter in the mail!?! What fun!
