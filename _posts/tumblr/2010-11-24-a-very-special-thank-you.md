The best projects are those for best friends.
This week, I had the great privilege of designing folded Thank You Notes for the mom of one of my dearest friends in college. Several years ago, she was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer. This battle has been met with great strength from this courageous woman and her family, because they have an unwavering hope in a God who is Trustworthy.
Many people have surrounded this family during her battle with cancer, even giving financially to support the great cost of medical expenses. To show her appreciation, she wanted to send a special thank you note.
Dressed in a very timely and appropriate Thanksgiving attire, here is our little note:
