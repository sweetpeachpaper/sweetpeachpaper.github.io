We celebrated my husbandâ€™s birthday and ordination service in May with lots of friends, the grill, and games on our front lawn. Of course, I have zero photos of the party because I was loony bins with a three month old and a house full of people, but the evening was so much fun!

The A7 invitation features mustard and pool colors (about as masculine as I can get), with big, bold, block lettering. A separate insert card gives extra details and the mustard envelope is finished off with a wrap around address label (per usual). Sometimes, I think I look for an excuse to throw a shindig, just for the chance to send out invitations. Tee hee.
