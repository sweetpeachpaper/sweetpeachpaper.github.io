Susan, who you probably already know (from [here](/spp-on-jess-barfield-photographys-blog) and [here](/susans-bridal-shower-invitations)), was married to her beau, Andrew, on Saturday! So of course on this Tuesday morning, I have to show off their wedding programs.

Here is a fact: I fancy kraft paper with everything inside me. It’s an obsession, a compulsion, a mania. So when Susan told me she wanted to do a booklet program featuring a kraft paper cover, I was in.

For the front cover, a unique logo was created spotlighting the bride and groom’s names and their wedding date. It was printed in a beautiful peacock blue to coordinate with the wedding colors.

The program insides featured all the regulars - Ceremony Order, Special Thanks, In Memory, and so on. But Susan and Andrew wanted to add something unique - notes to each of their bridesmaids and groomsmen. What a special gift!

On the final page of this lovely booklet, we used the same wreath design with directions to the reception, just a walk down the street from the old brick church.

The final touch, a twine ribbon, added a little woodsy flair to compliment this Alabama chapel wedding and barn reception.
