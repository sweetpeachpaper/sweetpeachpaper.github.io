Why let the paper goodness end with your wedding invitation!? ‘Day Of’ accessories are the perfect way to tie your day together. Continuing the fonts, colors, textures, monograms, and any other unique detail that appeared on your invitation throughout your wedding day may seem like a small detail, but its these details that can make the day have that very custom feel. It’s all in the details, folks.
Our Program - A small, accordion style booklet, featuring the yummy majolica blues and swirly fonts from the invitation.

See how great those hints of blue tie in with the bridesmaid’s dresses? Filling through the PMS color chart to find the perfect ‘majolica blue’ is absolutely worth it. 
Eat. It. Up.
