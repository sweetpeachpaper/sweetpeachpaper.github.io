It’s that time of year again. Love is in the air, the birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and people are gettin’ hitched … Which means presents, presents, presents!

I love to give a great gift but am trying to retrain my brain to know that great does not have to equal pricey. With the plethora of showers and weddings we’ve been attending lately, I’ve been jonesing for a solution to making something affordable extra special. A dear friend gave me the sweet - pun intended - inspiration I needed over lunch this past week.

If there’s one thing we love in Georgia, its sweet tea. So, starting with this pretty and affordable pitcher from the couple’s registry, I got to work.

I designed a recipe card for steeping tea and a recipe for simple syrup, as well as a little tag with the couple’s last name initial as the tea tag. These were printed out on Crane’s Lettra, and affixed to a bag of peach tea with some raffia to make the tea bag complete.

Put all this inside the pitcher and voila! The iPhone photos just don’t do it justice. Its pretty adorable. Do you have any great ideas for making shower gifts a little something extra special? 
Working on blog updates and ( fingers crossed ) a new website soon. Check back!
