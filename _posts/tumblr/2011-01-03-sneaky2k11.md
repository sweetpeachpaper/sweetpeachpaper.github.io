Working on several wedding invitations for what is now this year, and I find it beyond bizzar-o to be writing dates ending in “Two Thousand and Eleven.” How did this happen?!

Two-K-Eleven is shaping up to be a promising year already. I will be doing my first ever collaboration with a calligrapher for an uber-customized wedding invitation, pumpin’ out baby announcements galore, among other things.

I could not help but share a small sneak peek of this invitation for a stellar bride and groom:

Cannot wait for these beauties to get in the mailbox so I can officially share them with you. Creativity from this couple abounds!

Here’s to the first Monday of 2011.
