Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the Goebels and Sweet Peach Paper.

Now that our (extra late!) cards are off in the mailbox, I figured it was time to show these off on the blog. And a little snow even came our way in Georgia to give us a pretty photo shoot.

It’s been a great year full of lots of adventures. I am so thankful for the grace upon grace the Lord has brought to our lives, and for all of you who have supported this endeavor to launch Sweet Peach Paper. I could not have done it without each and every one of you. (Extra gratitude goes to [Shaun Menary](http://shaunmenary.com/blog), my constant advice giver, business manager, photographer extraodinaire … I am so thankful for you.). Can’t wait to see what 2011 brings for this little Goebel family and for Sweet Peach Paper!
