Georgia and Scott’s beautiful (and when I say beautiful, it’s because I can’t think of a word one hundred times better to describe this event in justice) South Carolina wedding is featured on [Style Me Pretty’s](http://www.stylemepretty.com/2012/03/12/highlands-wedding-by-melissa-schollaert-photography/) blog today … Along with some Sweet Peach Paper goodies.

SPP had the privilege of designing Georgia and Scott’s Save the Date and tags for the guest’s favors at the wedding. What a treat to be among such talented vendors like [Laura Hooper Calligraphy](http://lhcalligraphy.com/) and [Chocolate Butterbean](http://chocolatebutterbean.com/)!
