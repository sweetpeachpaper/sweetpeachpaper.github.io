Earlier this week, Sweet Peach Paper was featured on [Invitation Crush](http://www.invitationcrush.com)'s lovely [blog](http://www.invitationcrush.com/jennifer-pauls-majolica-blue-floral-invitations/). It took me a moment to realize these were our wedding invitations, since no one calls me Jennifer, except when I am in big-time trouble with my mom (cue fifteen-year-old flashbacks), but the double-take made me squeal! What a wonderful Monday morning surprise it was!
