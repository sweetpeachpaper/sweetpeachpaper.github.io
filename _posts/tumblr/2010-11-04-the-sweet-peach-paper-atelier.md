Yesterday afternoon, our humble abode was transformed into a full fledged studio for photographing the latest Sweet Peach Paper products. The one, the only, the world’s greatest Shaun, of [Shaun Menary Photography](http://shaunmenary.com/blog/), popped in a for a couple of hours to knock my socks off with his talent.

Renaissance man that he is, Shaun not only photographed tons of SPP projects, but styled each and every one in a unique and charming way. We grabbed things from all over the house (even the bedside table) to tailor the various projects. Seriously, Shaun’s artistic prowess is simply bewitching.

You’re bewitched, are you not?
