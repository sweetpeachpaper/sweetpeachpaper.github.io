It’s Sweet Peach Paper’s lucky day … We’re on the [Jess Barfield Photography](http://www.jessbarfield.com) Blog!

This past Friday night, the lovely McKenzie Griffin and I had the great pleasure of throwing a shower for our very soon-to-be married friend, Susan Ross, of [Susan Ross Photography](http://www.susanhudsonphotography.com).

We wanted the evening to suit Susan’s tastes - casual, eclectic, Anthropologie inspired loveliness. The invitations, place cards, and various tags were a great addition. Lucky for us, the fabulous Jess of [Jess Barfield Photography](http://www.jessbarfield.com) was there to capture the soiree.

It was such a wonderful evening celebrating Susan! Great food, great fun, and even greater friends - and, of course, presents. Topping off the evening with a girly viewing of “The Proposal” wasn’t bad either.

And special thanks to Ez from Creature Comforts for her [post](http://www.creaturecomfortsblog.com/home/2010/10/25/font-crush-dubtronic.html) on penant borders. I obviously loved them!
