There’s not much behind Sweet Peach Paper, just a sweet Georgia Peach. 

And that’s where the name came from. Jenni currently resides in the ever-fabulous Dallas, Texas with her husband, Paul, but the place she calls home is the ever-southern, ever-pleasant, ever-delightful Atlanta, Georgia.

In college, Jenni designed the front-page news for her school’s newspaper, The Samford Crimson, worked as a graphic design artist for the university’s various magazine publications, and was awarded the Southeastern Journalism Conference’s “Best Magazine Page Designer” in 2007. But, as she recalls, her favorite creative endeavors were for a handful of engaged friends during their senior year.

It wasn’t until Jenni was engaged in the fall of 2009 that she truly experienced the delights that paper had to offer. After designing and printing her own wedding invitation suite and other paper goods, she was hooked.

And so, Sweet Peach Paper was born.
